Title: Automatic Braking System for Vehicle to Reduce Accident Rate

Description:
Objective:

Design a automatic braking system that will stop vehicles when necessary. Here, this system that will help to reduce the rate of accident in the rode. In the case of driver’s fault it will automatically stop the vehicles. 

Introduction:

Our project is automatic Braking System for vehicle to reduce accident rate. when any obstacle come in front of vehicle suddenly it will be stopped Automatically  by using sensor. Many people or animal come suddenly infront of vehicle. In the winter season driver can’t see anything in the long distance for fog or somethings. So, it detect the object. it sends sound and detect how distance the object is. if it is necessary to break so, it stop the vehicle . If there is no need to stop the vehicle it reduce speed of the vehicle. So, we make this project for peoples & vehicle safety. 


Tools List:
Hardware : 
•	Micro-controller (ARDUINO-UNO); 
•	Gear Motor & Motor Driver;
•	7805-Voltage Regulator;
•	Battery & Charger;
•	Ultra-sonic Sensor etc. 

Software :
•	Arduino 1.8.1

Proposed Project description : 

Our Projrct is Automatic Braking System for Vehicle to Reduce Accident Rate. Accident rate increasing day by day for careless driving.We are expect, this project very helpful for our country. Because , this project never use before our country & day by day our accident rate high for careless driver & careless people.


This project use two mode:

•	Automatic : Sometimes driver can’t break instantly. When this system work automatically.
•	Bluetooth : Bluetooth means automatic driver/manual mode.


Flowchart : xxxxx

Comparism : xxxxx


Application : 

•	Many people find automatic simpler to drive. 
•	Learning in an automatic can let you concentrate more on speed & road position. 
•	Automatics can be more reliable than manuals.
