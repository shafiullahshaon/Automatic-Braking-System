Title: Automatic Braking System for Vehicle to Reduce Accident Rate

Description:
Common braking is not sufficient for the avoidance of accidents when the driver is not active. This automatic braking system allows the vehicle to brake without the support of the driver. Vehicles should automatically brake when the sensors sense the obstacle. 

End of the moment we can say that the objective of the project is to design an automatic braking system in order to avoid the accident. To develop a safely vehicle braking system using sensor and to design vehicle with less human attention to the driving. 

Mainly is used when driving the vehicle at night time. Mostly the accident occurred in the nighttime due to long travel the driver may get tried. So, the driver may hit the front side vehicle or roadside trees. By using this project the vehicle is stopped by automatic braking system. So, we can avoid the accident.
